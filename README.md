# AssafTech.GenericRepository

A Generic Repository is a common design pattern used to interact with a data source, typically a database, in a flexible and reusable way. It provides a set of generic methods for performing common data operations (e.g., Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD) without the need to write specific code for each data entity.
